>A high-level definition, it's another version of the JavaScript language based on vanilla JavaScript but with more features and functionality added in.  


In your own words, what is Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine?  
> Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is vanilla JavaScript as what is run in the browser. 


What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?  
> On a high-level look, a runtime is where code is executed. It could either be executed in the browser or in Node. If the runtime was the browser, all the javascript would be executed by the browser. If the runtime is in Node, it will be executed in Node.js instead.  


What is npm?  
> NPM is a node package manager. It is a 'library' of packages and modules that can be downloaded for Node. 


What version of Node are you running on your machine?  
> v18.8.0  


What version of npm are you running on your machine?  
> v8.18.0  


What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint'?  
> npm install --save-dev jshint  
> I would save this package as a dev dependency unless I used it often. Then I would use the -g flag.  



What is Node used for?  
>Node is used for executing JavaScript outside the browser.  
> It's an excellent runtime for backend servers such as express. 


6 Reasons for Pair Programming  

What are the six reasons for pair programming?  
>1. Greater efficiency  
>2. Engaged collaboration  
>3. Learning from fellow students  
>4. Social skills  
>5. Job interview readiness  
>6. Work environment readiness  




In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?  
> Learning from fellow students.  
> There is no better teacher than teaching. Most of the time, when pair programming, I am exposed to new approaches that clash with my approach; this creates bugs that push me to understand things "under the hood" and have a deeper understanding of tools that I may have taken for granted. 

How does pair programming work?  
>One person is coding/driving, while the other is the navigator. The navigator's job is to direct the code and do any required research while the driver does the coding.
