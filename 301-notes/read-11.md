Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:


| SQL                 | NoSQL                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| RDBMS               | Non-relationation     |
| Tables              | key-value pairs       |
| predefined schema   |	Dynamic Schema        |
| vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| SQL language        | Language varies       |
 	 
 	 
 	 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?  
>structured data that does not use key-value pairs. 


Give a real world example.  
> Data that is typically stored in a table can include transactional data for a business.  


What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?  
> Data that is typically stored in key-value pairs, that may not have much in common. 


Give a real world example.
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?  
> Session storage is complex and often times has a dynamic structure, and is easy to put into key value pairs. 


Which type of database is best for scalability?  
> SQL is best for vertically scaling, to get more performance you can add more CPU or RAM. 
> NoSQL is horizontally scalable, and would require adding nodes, and more servers to get better performance.

What does SQL stand for?
> Structured query language  


What is a relational database?  
>Each table has something in common, such as an ID, the two tables can be merged on that ID, its how they are "related"  


What type of structure does a relational database work with?  
> SQL
What is a ‘schema’?  
>its how a table will be layed out. What data will be stored in the table is listed in the Schema. 

What is a NoSQL database?  
> NoSQL is a database that stores is data in key-value pairs to be accessed quickly with a query

How does it work?  
> It uses collection's or store documents in key-value pairs

What is inside of a MongoDB database?  
> key-value pairs

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.  
>MongoDB is more flexible because you can test tables, and do not need to have ids in common to join data.


What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?  
>Duplicate data can making updating data difficult, because it will need to be updated in several spots.
