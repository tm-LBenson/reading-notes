[How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)  

Who is Roy Fielding?  
>Roy Fielding is the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.  

  
  

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?  
> Not all machines accross the world are designed to listen on the web, so a protocol was required to ensure all machines would be on a single standard. 
> 

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?  
> by applying verbs to nouns. Fielding was able to create a protocol that would allow a server to respond to different types of requests to the same address to handle data differently. 

What does a GET do?  
>It is normally used to retrieving data. 

What does a POST do?  
>It is normally used for pushing data to the backend, without displaying a query string

What does PUT do?  
>It is normally used for a major update of data

What does PATCH do?  
>It is normally used for a small update to part of existing data
