## [Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.  
> Most users in the early 2000s would be connecting with dial-up internet. Therefore, the use of video would be limited by internet speed. However, almost all users have access to higher internet speeds today, and videos and audio can be embedded onto any page to make a page more dynamic. 


Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.  
  > The SRC attribute is where the video is stored, typically a link to the video. Finally, the controls attribute allows users to control a video, which is essential for accessibility reasons. 
  
  
Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?  
  >If the SRC link breaks, or the user's broadband is too slow to load the video, then having fallback content will allow for something else to take the place of the video instead of shifting content on a page from its inability to load. 
  
  
Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.  
  >There was once an excellent star in the entertainment world; his name was "audio the star." He provided entertainment to everyone uncontested. Then one-day, broadband was invented. (enter video stage left). Video walked up to the audio and stabbed him to death; this is how video killed the audio star, and no one was sad about it. 
  
  
## [A Complete Guide To Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

How does Grid layout differ from Flex?  
  
  >A grid layout is two-dimensional, and Flex is adjusted in 1 dimension. Therefore, the Grid can be structured through templates, and a flexbox cannot. 
  
  
Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.  
  >Grid container is the parent element that contains a grid the grid line can be turned on to view the grid layout and see where items will align when using the grid system. the grid items are the elements contained within the grid container and will be manipulated 
  
  
## [Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)  

Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?  
  
  > Making images responsive makes a site more professional, attracting a wider audience. It can also improve SEO bringing your site to the top of google searches.  
  
  
Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.
  >```<img>``` is the tag used to add the attributes srcset, and sizes. srcset allows for a list of images to the browser can choose a lower quality image for lower network speeds, display types, or sizes. In addition, it allows for a responsive design and a more dynamic page. 
  
  
How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?  
  >If I were to use CSS or JavaScript to make multiple images responsive, I would have to set display none to the extra images and load them in even if they are not being used. With srcset the images are only loaded in if the browser says they are needed.
