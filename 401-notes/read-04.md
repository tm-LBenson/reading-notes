#### What type of database is the best fit for the complex query-intensive environment?  
  
  SQL is the best bit for a complex query-intensive environment  
  
#### What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?  
  
  The best fit for hierarchical data storage is NoSQL because it uses key-value pairs and its ability to nest data. 
  
#### Describe the differences in scalability between a SQL and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.  
  
  SQL requires a Schema, such as a blueprint of how the data being stored in the database will look. SQL data is typically laid out like in a spreadsheet. NoSQL doesn't care what that data looks like or how the data is laid out. It will accept it in most formats.

#### Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship, and how do we "relate" them?  
  
  A one-to-many relationship is having a single table with a relationship to many other tables. For example, on Twitter, a User would relate to the many tweets they post. 
  We use the foreign and primary keys to create a relation between a single table and the many tables and rows they relate to it.
  
#### Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.  
  
  Create a diagram
  
#### Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.  
  
  A primary key is a unique one to identify each table row. 
  A foreign key is a column or set of columns that match a primary key in another table.

#### How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?
  
  SQL keywords are normally written in all CAPS and parameters are written in lowercase
  
#### Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.  
  
  Normalization is the process to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data integrity in the table
  
#### Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.  
  
  One-to-one is like husband to wife
  One-to-many is like husband to children
  Many-to-many is like incoming mail in a house to people living in the house 
  
Reflection
#### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My learning goals are to retain what I am learning. There is so much in the README to learn and less time than I would like to know it all. I plan to take notes on topics I want to revisit later to ensure I get the most out of this course.
