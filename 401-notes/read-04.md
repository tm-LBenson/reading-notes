Reflection
#### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My learning goals are to retain what I am learning. There is so much in the README to learn, and not as much time as I would like to learn it all. I plan to take notes on topics I want to revisit later to ensure I get the most out of this course.
