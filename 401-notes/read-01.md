# Readings: Node Ecosystem  


## Reading  
[Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)  

### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?  
The Node.js homepage defines it as:
>“Node.js® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.”  
To a "non-technical" it’s another version of the JavaScript language based on vanilla JavaScript but with more features and functionality added in. 


### What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?  
  Instead of JavaScript being executed in the browser and having access to browser API's JavaScript is being executed in Node. It can be thought of a location to run JavaScript.  
  
  
### What is Node used for?  
  Node is used to run JavaScript outside of the browser. Some uses of Node include Backend and Servers, microservices, development of APIs, front-end libraries such as React, scripting & automation, and infinitely more services.
