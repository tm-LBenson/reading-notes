# Readings: Node Ecosystem  


## Reading  
[Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)  

### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?  
The Node.js homepage defines it as:
>“Node.js® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.”  

To a "non-technical" it’s another version of the JavaScript language based on vanilla JavaScript but with more features and functionality added in. 


### What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?  
  Instead of JavaScript being executed in the browser and having access to browser API's JavaScript is being executed in Node. It can be thought of a location to run JavaScript.  
  
  
### What is Node used for?  
  Node is used to run JavaScript outside of the browser. Some uses of Node include Backend and Servers, microservices, development of APIs, front-end libraries such as React, scripting & automation, and infinitely more services. 
  
## Additional Questions  
### Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?  
  There is nothing I do not look forward to learning in this upcoming schedule. I would love to add more to this list. Of all the topics I am looking forward to the most would be learning React with hooks, and Redux.  
  
### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?  
 After reading the README, my learning goals are to master the workflow of building and deploying Node applications, modules, and tests; I will seamlessly be able to perform all tasks anytime required without referencing my notes.
