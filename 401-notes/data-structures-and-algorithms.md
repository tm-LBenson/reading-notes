### Discussion Questions
### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?  
One of the most important things to consider is the scalability of the data. For example, if you require a data structure to handle each day in a month, the largest this data structure will grow is 31 elements. An array could be a proper data structure for this example. However, a single array would be a poor choice if you have more complex data with the potential of infinite scaling that would hold millions of indexes. A hash table may be a better choice for scaling data due to its ability to handle nested data structures of different types. Each situation is going to vary depending on the data. 

### How can we ensure that we'll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?  
An infinite recursive call stack occurs when a function calls itself with no conditional statement or a way to ```return``` out of the function. To prevent an infinite recursive call stack, adding a conditional with a return statement that will eventually be met will stop the loop.
