## Reading

[Read today’s Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-14/lab/)

Note: Requirement is to spend one lab session working on this project, however additional time may be an option. Due date will be given in class and we’ll present briefly at the beginning of the next module.

- Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.

1. A help ticket system like remo uses. When someone puts in a ticket, it will Let the TAs know. When the ticket is closed, it removes the ticket and goes to the next student
2. News updating application. When news related to a certain group comes down the wire, the application will let the correct people know what's going on

Reflection

#### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My primary goal is to debug my issues and understand why they occurred. I want to be able to build socket applications with confidence in the syntax and not think about why it could be throwing errors; instead, just have it work.
