# Implementation: Linked Lists  
  
## Some ideas for how you might want to teach:  
  
- Use an analogy  
- Explain a detail in depth  
- Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure  
- Tutorial / walk through an example  
- Write a quiz  
- Create a vocabulary/definition list  
- Write a cheat sheet  
- Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic  
- Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them  
- Build a map of the information  
- Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic
