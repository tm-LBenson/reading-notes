# Ethics in Tech

The first article, "Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?" explores the potential dangers and consequences of the increasing use of big data and artificial intelligence in society. The article highlights the ways in which companies and governments may use these technologies to manipulate individuals and society as a whole, leading to a loss of privacy and democratic control. The author also raises concerns about the potential for these technologies to cause economic upheaval and job displacement.

My thoughts on the article align with the author's concerns. The increasing use of big data and AI can certainly have negative consequences if not properly regulated and controlled. The idea of a "data-controlled society" as described in the article is certainly a chilling thought, and one that should be taken seriously. Additionally, the potential for these technologies to be used for manipulation and control is a real concern.

One specific point that stood out to me from the article was the idea of a "filter bubble" or "echo chamber effect" where individuals are only exposed to information that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs. This can lead to further social polarization and division.

The second article, "The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice" lays out a code of ethics for software engineers to follow in order to ensure that their work benefits society and is conducted in a responsible and professional manner. The code includes principles such as acting in the public interest, maintaining integrity and independence in professional judgement, and promoting an ethical approach to software development and maintenance.

I agree with the principles outlined in the article and believe that a code of ethics for those working in technology is important. As the article states, software engineers have significant opportunities to do good or cause harm, and it is important for them to be aware of this and to act accordingly. The principle that stood out to me the most was the one about maintaining integrity and independence in professional judgement. This is especially important in the context of the potential for technology to be used for manipulation and control.

One point that I thought the article could have delved into more was the issue of how to handle ethical dilemmas that may arise in the course of software development. The principles outlined in the code of ethics are important, but it is not always clear how to apply them in practice.

Another point that I would like to mention is that ChatGPT, as a language model, could be used to hurt people by spreading false information, promoting hate speech, and manipulating people's opinions, it's important to have a code of ethics that governs the use of this technology as well.
