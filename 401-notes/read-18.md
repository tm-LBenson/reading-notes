# Readings: AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Reading

[AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/guides/amazon-api-gateway)

#### What is Amazon API Gateway?

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

#### Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?

It is an important part of the serverless ecosystem because it lets developers build and deploy APIs that can be used to trigger and invoke serverless functions or other backend services. It is fully integrated with other AWS services, making it easy to build and deploy serverless applications that leverage the power of the AWS Cloud.

#### How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?

API Gateway integrates with many AWS services, such as AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Cognito, and CloudWatch, to provide a flexible platform for building and deploying APIs.

#### What are the some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?

API Gateway is easy to use, scalable, secure, and integrates with other services. It provides detailed monitoring and logging, and is a powerful platform for building and deploying APIs.

#### What two API types might you choose from?

The two API types I can choose from are REST APIs or WebSocket APIs

[AWS DynamoDB Guide](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db/)

#### What is DynamoDB?

DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database

#### Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?

DynamoDB is fully managed, has fast and predictable performance, automatically scales, and integrates with other AWS services. It is well suited for use in serverless architectures and applications requiring real-time data access or high-throughput workloads.

#### Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.

DynamoDB is like a project management tool for a construction project. It helps you store and retrieve data in a structured way, just like a project management tool helps you track the progress of a construction project. It allows you to assign tasks, track the status of each task, and make updates as needed.

[Dynamoose](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

#### What is Dynamoose?

Dynamoose is a JavaScript ORM library for DynamoDB.

#### What are some key features of Dynamoose?

Object modeling interface: Dynamoose provides an interface that allows developers to define models for their data and use them to create, retrieve, update, and delete items in a DynamoDB table.

Support for advanced features: Dynamoose also provides support for advanced features of DynamoDB, such as secondary indexes, conditional updates, and transactions.

## Reflection

#### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
My primary goal is to feel more comfortable working with AWS. There are many ways to navigate the tool, and easy mistakes can create costly bugs.
