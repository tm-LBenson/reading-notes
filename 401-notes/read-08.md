### What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?  
  
  
  
### Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.  
  
  
  
### What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

### If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?  
  
  Authorization is having permission to access data because of the role assigned to who you are. 
  
### Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.  
  
>Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.   
>
>Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.  
>
>Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.

### Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.  
  
  RBAC is like allowing a doctor to see your medical history, but not allowing other patients to view your files, even if they share the same doctor. The doctor has a role that allows him access to that information.

### What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.  
  
  Rights are associated with the role. The role decides which rights the user can access, because a user can be assigned a role for access. 
  
  
### Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?  
  
  After a user sucessfully authenticates, access rights or authorization can be activated. 
  
### Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.  
  
  It can allow supervisers or managers to access different data than general users or employees. In a learning enviroment, it can allow a teacher to view all students assignments but not allow students to see each others work.
