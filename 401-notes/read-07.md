### What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?  
  
  A JSON Web Token is a 3 part token send as encoded JSON to a client from a server during authentication. The header contains the method of encoding, and the type of token. The second part is the payload, and contains JSON with the users data, meta data, and any relevent data the server will require. The third part is the signature, which is made up of an encrypted secret.
