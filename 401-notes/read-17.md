#### Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

The code is run in response to events.
serverless computing allows you to run code without having to worry about the servers that it is running on. AWS Lambda is a service that makes it easy to use serverless computing by providing a simple way to run your code and automatically scaling the infrastructure as needed.

[CDN](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/)

#### What is a CDN?

A CDN is a content delivery network. Its a way to delivery web content to users based on their geographic location

#### How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

A content delivery network (CDN) works by replicating content from a central location and storing it on servers located in multiple data centers around the world, and then delivering the content from the nearest server to the user's location when a user requests it, in order to improve the speed and performance of the website or service.

#### What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

The benefits of employing a content delivery network (CDN) include improved performance and availability of websites and other web-based services, reduced load on the origin server, and protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

## Reflection
