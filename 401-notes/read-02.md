# Readings: Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD  
  
## Reading  
[An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)  
  
### Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.  

Middleware are custom functions, or scripts are run on the request or response objects. They are ran during the request-respons-cycle.  
  
### Express the most popular __ __ ____.  

Node Web Framework
  
### Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?  

Unopinionated means there isn't a "right way" to do things. That can make the framework more versatile yet more challenging to use. 
  
### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?  
A module is a JavaScript library or file that can be imported with the require method. 
  
[What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)    
  
### What version of npm are you running on your machine?  
  
version 9.1.2  
### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?  
  
```npm i jshint```    
[What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'tdd))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))   



### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.  
Tests are an important part of making sure code works before it goes into production. It allows for a way to check edge cases without having to rely on user feedback, or having unexpected downtime. 

### What are three expected benefits of testing  
Directly from the reading:  
> - many teams report significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort  
> - the same teams tend to report that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases  
> - although empirical research has so far failed to confirm this, veteran practitioners report that TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling  

  
  

### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.  
[CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8&ab_channel=GitHubTraining%26Guides)  

### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?  
  
### What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?  
  
### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
