## Readings  
[Read today's Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-09/lab/)  
  
Note: The requirement is to spend one lab session working on this project; however, additional time may be an option. The due date will be given in class, and we'll present briefly at the beginning of the next module.  
  
### Discuss 2 possible project ideas that you and a partner could complete in the allotted time.  
  
 - Cars Vs. Trucks fan club / The application would take in user input from the command line interface to build out the user's role based on their preference for cars and trucks. The database would be seeded with a list of vehicles and a list of trucks depending on the user's chosen role. They can add more of the type of vehicle they chose, edit the current selection, or remove the ones they do not like. 
 
 - Another possibility is a video game library based on chosen genre. Again, the user would be prompted via the command line to select a few games, and based on those selections; the user would be assigned a role to view a library with CRUD-capable commands.

## Reflection  
### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?  
  I hope to have a firm understanding of the previous labs and confidence in my ability to build an application and present it similarly.
