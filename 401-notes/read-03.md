#### How would you describe a constructor and contextual “this” to a non-technical friend?  
  
  A class constructor is like the blueprints for a house. You can build several houses from 1 set of blueprints, and each house will look the same, but they are all different houses. The word 'This' would refer to the current house being built by the blueprints. Each time the blueprints are read, and a house is being built, the 'This" keyword refers to that current house.
