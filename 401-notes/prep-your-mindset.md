### Assess your emotional intelligence. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.  
  
In the past year, I have grown significantly in all areas. I used to become very outspoken when discussing topics that were core to my identity, primarily when the discussion was related to my upbringing or my past. I have realized that everyone will have different feelings about things, and being open-minded to other opinions is a great way to learn more about those situations. It is much easier to manage my moods and keep my professional growth separate from my emotions.   
  
### Assess your biases. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.  
  
Everyone comes from a different background, and not everyone is given the same opportunities, but if someone works hard enough and long enough towards something, it can be achieved. That doesn't mean everyone has to work the same amount to achieve the same goals. Sometimes opportunities can be given to those based on situations, backgrounds, and circumstances. Sometimes deserving people are passed up for opportunities because of their experience. The quiz was interesting; I am happy with where I scored, but this is something that only some will be perfect at, and I will have to continue to strive to grow in the area of bias.
