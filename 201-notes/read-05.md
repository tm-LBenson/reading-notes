I could add black or dark backgrounds to borders around certain elements to make them "pop."

What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
>You should consider what the web page is being used for. For example, serif fonts are often used on websites for older establishments to give them the old roman look.

For example, you could use a san-serif ```<H1>``` and a serif ```<H2>``` element to give the site some accented fonts and bring attention to specific areas.

> font size changes the height and width of each character. Font weight adds thickness to characters; for example, a font weight of 700 will create bold text. 



Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
>To add spacing around characters you can use the letter-spacing property to push characters apart. You can use the line-spacing property to add spacing between lines. You can also use a different font which has extra space between the characters by default.
