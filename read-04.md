Hyperlinks are another fundamental subject that will allow me to create multiple pages or links to outside sources. Laying out CSS can be very challenging. A basic understanding of flow, block elements, and positioning will be used with most styling techniques. Having modular, reusable code will allow me to apply the DRY principle and add lots of functionality to my pages.

## Creating Hyperlinks

To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?  
>We wrap text inside the "`<a>` "elements to create a basic link


The href attribute contains what information?  
>the href attribute contains the URL to the link provided inside the "`<a>` "tag  


What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

  > Be sure to write the title of the link in plain text so it can be read/clicked by the user  


# CSS Layout  
## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning  

What is meant by "normal flow"?   
From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Introduction  
  > "Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout."  


What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?  
>block elements take up all the space of an element left and right  
>inline elements fall in line with the text. They only take up the space required to fit their dimensions.  


___ positioning is the default for every HTML element.  
  from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning  
> "Static positioning is the default that every element gets."  


Name a few advantages to use absolute positioning on an element.  
> using absolute position takes an element out of the flow of text. This can allow stand-alone positioning for the element without affecting any other elements on the page. This is also a way to place elements behind other elements.


What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?  
>absolute positions relative to the parent element, fixed positioning positions an element in relation to the viewport, so it stays on the screen as the page is scrolled.
