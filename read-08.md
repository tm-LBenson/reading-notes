Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.  




Explain the difference between the main axis and the cross axis.  
> The main axis is vertical if the parent element is positioned in a column. Moving elements in the flexbox will move them up and down with the justify-content property.
> If the parent element is positioned in a row, the main axis is horizontal, so moving child elements with justify-content will move them horizontally.
>the cross axis will run perpendicular to the main axis, allowing for align-items to move items up and down during column direction, and left and right with row direction.
